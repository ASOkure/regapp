<h1>Access to the Registry</h1>
<p>
    Clinical users can upload and edit cases from their centre. A Centre Lead in each centre is responsible for all
    clinical data (including deletion of records).<!--   Clinical users can view the whole dataset of their own cases and the
    core dataset of all available cases.-->
</p>
<p>
    Accessing the Registry for research requires further information and approval. Please see the
    <a target="_blank"
       href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/medicine/research/childhealth/i-dsdproject/research/">Research</a>
    area of the website for details. Once approved, a Researcher will be able to view the whole dataset of all available
    cases for a set period of time.
