<h1>New Registry Developments</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Clinical users see full dataset of their  own  centre's cases.  Since April 2016, access  to data
     of all  other cases, whether for clinical or research purposes, is by completion of a 
     data access form  and a data  sharing agreement.  See the  <a href="">research area</a> of the website 
     for further information.

  </li>
  <li>
    Modules - When creating a record, only the core dataset is mandatory, all other modules are optional.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>UKCRN Portfolio</h1>

  The Registry is included in the UKCRN portfolio -
