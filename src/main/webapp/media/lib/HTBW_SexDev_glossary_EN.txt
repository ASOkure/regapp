ADH= A hormone (antediuretic hormone) that causes the body to retain water.&Adrenal glands=A pair of endocrine glands that sit above the kidneys. These glands make important hormones, including cortisol and androgen.&Amniocentesis=A test done on a pregnant woman to determine the chromosomal make-up of the foetus. Among other things, amniocentesis can tell if the foetus has XX or XY sex chromosomes.&Androgen=A kind of steroid hormone that has masculinizing effects.&antidiuretic hormone= A hormone that causes the body to retain water. Also called ADH.&Cervix=The narrow lower end of the uterus that leads into the vagina.&Chromosome=A microscopic, string-like structure that holds a person's genes (DNA). Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of the cell.&Clitoris=A small, sensitive organ at the front of the vulva. The clitoris plays a role in female sexual pleasure.&Conception=The moment when a sperm fertilizes an egg.&Corpora (singular, corpus)=The columns of tissue that make up the body of the penis and clitoris. The corpora become erect during sexual arousal. &Cortisol=A steroid hormone made by the adrenal glands.&Dihydrotestosterone=A sex hormone made from testosterone. Also called DHT.&DNA=The molecule that carries genetic information. DNA stands for "deoxyribonucleic acid."&Embryo=The developing human, from the time the zygote implants in the uterus, to the end of the eighth week of development. (After the eighth week, the developing human is called a foetus.)&Endocrine system=The network of glands that make chemical signals to regulate the body's functions. The endocrine system includes the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, ovaries, testes, and part of the pancreas.&Estrogen=A kind of steroid sex hormone that has feminizing effects.&Foetus=The developing human, from the ninth week of development until birth.&Foreskin=A fold of skin that covers the glans of the penis.&Gamete=A sex cell with 23 chromosomes. In human males, this is a sperm cell; in human females, it is an ovum (egg cell).&Genitals=The reproductive organs.&Germ cell=A sex cell with 23 chromosomes. In human males, this is a sperm cell; in human females, it is an ovum (egg cell).&Glans=The tip of the penis or clitoris.&Gonadotropins=Hormones released by the pituitary gland that cause the gonads to release sex hormones and that play other roles in reproduction.&Gonads=The reproductive glands: ovaries in a female, testes in a male.&Gynecomastia=Breast growth in a male.&Homologue=Something that is similar to something else.&Hormone=A kind of chemical that circulates in the body, carrying instructions from one body part to another.&Hymen=A membrane that surrounds or covers the opening of the vagina.&Indifferent genitals=The genitals of both male and female embryos, before they differentiate.&Indifferent gonads=The sex glands of both male and female embryos, before they differentiate.&Labia majora=The outer folds of tissue that surround the vulva.&Labia minora=The inner folds of tissue that surround the vestibule of the vagina.&Labioscrotal swellings=The part of the indifferent genitals that will become the labia majora in a girl and the scrotum in a boy.&Menarche=The stage in puberty when a girl begins to have menstrual periods.&MIS=M端llerian Inhibiting Substance. The chemical that makes the M端llerian ducts disappear in a male foetus. Also called Anti-M端llerian Hormone (AMH).&M端llerian ducts=A set of internal ducts that become the uterus, uterine (fallopian) tubes, and part of the vagina in a female foetus. Also called paramesonephric ducts.&Ovaries=Plural of 'ovary'. A female's reproductive glands.&Ovum (plural: Ova)=The female sex cell.&Penis=A male's external sexual and urinary organ.&Phallus=That part of the indifferent genitals that will become the glans of the clitoris in a female and the glans of the penis in a male.&Pituitary gland=An endocrine gland located in the brain. Among other functions, the pituitary releases the gonadotropins (hormones) that lead to the start of puberty.&Prepuce=A fold of skin that covers the glans of the penis or clitoris.&Prostate gland=A male gland that makes fluid that is part of semen.&Puberty=A child's transition to sexual maturity.&Scrotum=The sac of tissue that holds the testicles.&Seminal vesicles=Glands that make fluid that is part of semen.&Sex chromosomes=The X and Y chromosomes. These are two of the 46 chromosomes in most human cells. The combination of X and Y (either XX or XY) usually dictates a person's sex. XX is usually female; XY is usually male.&Sperm=The male sex cell.&Spermatic ducts=The tubes that carry semen into the urethra for ejaculation.&SRY gene=Sex-determining region of the Y chromosome. This gene gives instruction for the development of testes.&Testes=(Singular: testis) A male's reproductive glands.&Testis-determining factor (TDF)=A chemical made in the indifferent gonad in a male embryo, in response to instructions from the SRY gene. &Testosterone=A steroid sex hormone that has masculinizing effects.&Ureters=Tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.&Urethra=The tube that carries urine out of the body.&Urogenital folds=The part of the indifferent genitals that will become the labia minora in a girl and the penis surrounding the urethra in a boy.&Uterine (fallopian) tubes=Tubes that carry eggs from the ovary to the uterus.&Uterus=The organ that can carry and nourish a developing foetus.&Vagina=The passageway that leads from the uterus to the outside of the body.&Vestibule of the vagina=The external opening between the labia minora that is shared by the vagina and the urethra.&Vulva=A female's external genitals.&Wolffian ducts=The set of internal ducts that become the spermatic ducts in a male foetus. Also called mesonephric ducts.&X chromosome=A chromosome involved in sex determination. Most females have two X chromosomes; most males have one X and one Y.&Y chromosome=A chromosome involved in sex determination. Most females have two X chromosomes; most males have one X and one Y.&Zygote=A fertilized egg; in other words, the cell made by the union of an egg and a sperm.
